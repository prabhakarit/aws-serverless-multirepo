As an AI language model, I cannot write code on my own. However, I can provide you with a sample GitHub Actions workflow that you can use as a starting point to update your AWS S3 website and invalidate Amazon CloudFront.

Here's an example:



This workflow will trigger on every push to the main branch. It will then run two steps:

1. Sync the files in your repository to your S3 bucket, deleting any files that are no longer present in the repository.
2. Invalidate the CloudFront cache for your distribution, so that the updated files are immediately available to your users.

To use this workflow, you'll need to replace `your-bucket-name` and `your-distribution-id` with the actual names of your S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution, respectively. You'll also need to set up AWS access keys as GitHub secrets, so that the workflow can authenticate with AWS.

I hope this helps!
